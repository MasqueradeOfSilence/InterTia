For CS 456, I am required to put at least 55 hours of work into this project. Whatever I do not finish through the course, I will finish during the summer of 2021, considering that I was already planning on building this app and CS 456 simply provided a great way for me to get credit for it!

I will only be doing a timelog for the class.
